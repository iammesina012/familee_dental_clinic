# Automatic Daily Backup - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

**Before:**
- Automatic backup only worked if the app was open at 11:59 PM
- Toggle kept turning off because SharedPreferences wasn't persisting properly
- Unreliable backup schedule

**After:**
- ✅ Backups run on the server at 11:59 PM daily (app doesn't need to be open)
- ✅ Toggle state persists correctly in Supabase database
- ✅ Reliable, server-side scheduled backups

## What Was Changed

### 1. Created Supabase Infrastructure

**New Files:**
- `supabase/functions/daily-backup/index.ts` - Edge function that creates backups
- `supabase/functions/daily-backup/cron.json` - Cron schedule configuration
- `supabase/migrations/20250101000000_create_backup_preferences.sql` - Database table for preferences
- `supabase/config.toml` - Supabase configuration
- `supabase/README.md` - Full documentation
- `supabase/QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide
- `supabase/deploy.ps1` - Automated deployment script

### 2. Updated Flutter App

**Modified File:**
- `lib/features/backup_restore/services/automatic_backup_service.dart`

**Changes:**
- Removed SharedPreferences dependency
- Now stores auto-backup preference in Supabase database
- Stores last backup date in Supabase
- Ensures user preferences record exists on initialization

### 3. Database Schema

**New Table:** `user_backup_preferences`
```sql
- user_id (UUID, references auth.users)
- user_email (TEXT)
- auto_backup_enabled (BOOLEAN)
- last_backup_date (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

**Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only access their own preferences
- Service role can access all (for edge function)

## How It Works

1. **User enables auto-backup** in Flutter app
   - Preference is saved to `user_backup_preferences` table in Supabase
   
2. **Edge function runs daily at 11:59 PM**
   - Queries all users with `auto_backup_enabled = true`
   - For each user, checks if backup was already created today
   - Creates encrypted backup and uploads to Supabase Storage
   - Updates `last_backup_date` in database
   - Logs activity in `activity_logs` table

3. **Backup retention**
   - Keeps only the latest 10 backups per user
   - Automatically cleans up old backups

## Deployment Steps

### Quick Version

```powershell
# 1. Install Supabase CLI
scoop install supabase

# 2. Login and link project
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# 3. Run deployment script
.\supabase\deploy.ps1

# 4. Set up cron job in Supabase dashboard (SQL provided in QUICKSTART.md)
```

### Manual Version

See `supabase/README.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## Testing

### Test Edge Function
```powershell
supabase functions invoke daily-backup --no-verify-jwt
```

### Check Preferences
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_backup_preferences;
```

### View Function Logs
```powershell
supabase functions logs daily-backup
```

### View Backups
Go to Supabase Dashboard > Storage > backups > familee-backups

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Server-side execution ensures backups run on schedule
2. **Persistence**: Database storage prevents toggle from resetting
3. **Scalability**: Works for multiple users simultaneously
4. **Monitoring**: Edge function logs provide visibility
5. **Security**: Same encryption as manual backups
6. **Cost-effective**: Minimal edge function invocations (1/day)

## Important Notes

- **Timezone**: Cron runs at 11:59 PM UTC by default (adjust as needed)
- **Encryption**: Uses same encryption service as manual backups
- **Retention**: Maximum 10 backups per user
- **Permissions**: Only Owner role can enable auto-backup

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users

The app will automatically:
1. Create a `user_backup_preferences` record on first use
2. Default `auto_backup_enabled` to `false`
3. User needs to toggle it ON again in the app

**Note:** Previous SharedPreferences settings won't be migrated automatically. Users will need to enable the toggle again.

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Configurable backup time
- Multiple daily backups
- Backup to multiple locations
- Email notifications when backup fails
- Backup size optimization
- Incremental backups

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `supabase/README.md` for troubleshooting
2. Review edge function logs
3. Verify database migrations were applied
4. Test edge function manually before relying on cron
